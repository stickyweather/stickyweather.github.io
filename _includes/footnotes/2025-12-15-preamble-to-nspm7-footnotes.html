    <li id="footnote-1">Although in the tradition I was raised in &mdash; a strange blend of ultra-conservative, Christian-nationalist Calvinist fundamentalism from the small private school I attended and a sort of non-denominational spin on Church of Christ from my church &mdash; care was always taken to emphasize that, while God created the universe and is, indeed, <em>in</em> the universe, God is not the universe. Rather, it was always explained to me, God is in the universe the way an artist is in their paintings. That is, one might recognize the universe as God's handiwork the same way one might recognize a certain painting as a Van Gogh or a Picasso. Poetic, perhaps, but it always smacked of apologetics doublespeak to me. <a href="#footnote-ref-1">[↑]</a></li>
    <li id="footnote-2">I should note that I've chosen to include the footnote translation of this text, as noted in the New International Version (NIV) of the Bible. The regular, non-footnote version says "…the kingdom of God is in your midst." I also find this translation quite compelling, but I thought the footnote version better suited my point. <a href="#footnote-ref-2">[↑]</a></li>
